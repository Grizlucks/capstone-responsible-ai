# Introduction

The explosive proliferation of research around ethical AI (Artificial Intelligence) and AI trustworthiness during the last decade  reflects a rising societal awareness and desire to address potential and actual harmful impacts and consequences of AI. We introduce students to the socio-technical risks of AI fairness and explainability by examining several high-profile algorithmic discrimination debates that have sparked seminal research in this field. We will discuss the range of alternative definitions, the perspectives they represent, and metrics used to examine AI fairness, and the papers that describe the interesting yet mathematically irreconcilable relationships that interweave them. Concepts around AI-fairness will be translated into real-world applications through classroom debates from the perspectives of different disciplines and stakeholders, and by replicating the analyses from a relevant use case example. Students will conduct an independent fairness and explainability analysis on a mock model using industry recognized toolkits, with an emphasis on understanding how issues that originate in code and math eventually affect real human beings and society as a whole.

**In this domain, project proposals will be restricted to the following
areas:**
* What does AI trustworthiness and ethics mean for different stakeholders?
* What are the ways to think about whether or not a model is fair?
* What are the risks of ‘black box’ algorithms, and how do we mitigate them? How is AI explainability related to fairness?
* How do inherent fairness problems in AI models affect human beings?  

### Instructor: Dr. David Danks
David Danks is a Professor of Data Science & Philosophy at University of California, San Diego as well as affiliate faculty in UCSD’s Department of Computer Science & Engineering. He serves on advisory boards for various organizations including: National AI Advisory Committee (NAIAC), Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP), Partnership to Advance Responsible Technology (PART), Center for Advancing Safety of Machine Intelligence (CASMI), Topos Institute, AI Community of Practice (US Government), and Grefenstette Center for Ethics in Science, Tech., & Law. He has received a James S. McDonnell Foundation Scholar Award (2008) and an Andrew Carnegie Fellowship (2017). Previously, he was the L.L. Thurstone Professor of Philosophy & Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University. While at CMU, he served as the Chief Ethicist of CMU’s Block Center for Technology & Society and co-director of CMU’s Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity (IDeaS). 

### Industry Partner: Deloitte, Trustworthy AI Team
As one of the largest professional services organizations in the United States, Deloitte provides a vast array of information security services across 2,800 engagements in major commercial industries and 15 cabinet-level federal agencies. Our Trustworthy AI team has helped many of our clients work through the burgeoning regulatory landscape and growing awareness around ethical and trustworthy AI. For this course, the Deloitte team will consist of Rasmus Nielsen, Aritra Nath, Emma Harvey, Nandita Rahman, Meira Gilbert, and Jeffry Liu. We’re excited to work with UCSD in developing this course, and we look forward to discussing these exciting topics with you.

# Course Resources
### Office Hours
* Professor Danks will hold office hours Wednesdays 3-4PM in UC 302, Room 101 
* Deloitte: Will hold ad-hoc office hours (TBD) for assistance with replication project materials

### Course Communications
Please send any questions to the Responsible AI Microsoft Teams Channel (*Sign up Link TBA*): 
* Channel link: *coming soon*
* For any issues with MS Teams, email Nandita Rahman (nanrahman@deloitte.com) or your UCSD Faculty Mentor
For private or personal questions, you can reach out to the course instructors privately via MS Teams or email (ddanks@ucsd.edu). 

## Assignment Submission
Participation questions should be submitted to Gradescope and will be due 24 hours prior to the start of the class for which they are assigned. Other assignments, including both one-off tasks and assignments related to the replication project, should be submitted to Gradescope will be due at the start of the class for which they are assigned.

## Course Structure and Assignments
### Primary Objectives, Quarter 1
* Introduce students to the area in which they will do their project through replicating a known result.
* Create written material and code that serves as a foundation for work in quarter-2’s projects.
* Closely read example papers in the domain to learn best-practices for communication in the chosen field.
### Result replication (introduction to topic)
Title: To Be Announced
* Coming Soon

### Grading: Please see the Capstone Program Syllabus for a detailed description of the assignment weights and rubric. 
### Weekly Participation Credit: Weekly Reading and corresponding discussion post, **plus *one* in-class brief**
Each week, students will be assigned a set of readings. There is no textbook for this course; all readings are freely available and links will be provided. Each student is responsible for reading all content in full prior to the start of each week’s course, as the readings will guide the week’s discussion. Students will be responsible for engaging with the readings in the following ways:

  * **Weekly Readings:** _It is suggested to read these early in the week so you may post in the discussion, or present your brief_
  * **Discussion Questions:** For each set of weekly readings, discussion questions will be provided. These responses will be **due 24 hours prior to the start of each session. Post responses to discussion questions to Gradescope.
  * **In-class Brief:** Following the first session, students will have the opportunity to sign up to present on one of the course readings. Students are responsible for creating a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the reading, including its background, methodology, argument/key contributions, and their thoughts on the implications/impact of the article. Reading presentations are due via Gradescope prior to the start of the session for which the reading is assigned; students are also responsible for presenting to the rest of the class during the session. Presentations should take five minutes.
