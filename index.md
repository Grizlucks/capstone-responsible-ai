# Introduction

The explosive proliferation of research around ethical AI (Artificial Intelligence) and AI trustworthiness during the last decade  reflects a rising societal awareness and desire to address potential and actual harmful impacts and consequences of AI. We introduce students to the socio-technical risks of AI fairness and explainability by examining several high-profile algorithmic discrimination debates that have sparked seminal research in this field. We will discuss the range of alternative definitions, the perspectives they represent, and metrics used to examine AI fairness, and the papers that describe the interesting yet mathematically irreconcilable relationships that interweave them. Concepts around AI-fairness will be translated into real-world applications through classroom debates from the perspectives of different disciplines and stakeholders, and by replicating the analyses from a relevant use case example. Students will conduct an independent fairness and explainability analysis on a mock model using industry recognized toolkits, with an emphasis on understanding how issues that originate in code and math eventually affect real human beings and society as a whole.

In this domain, project proposals will be restricted to the following
areas:
* What does AI trustworthiness and ethics mean for different stakeholders?
* What are the ways to think about whether or not a model is fair?
* What are the risks of ‘black box’ algorithms, and how do we mitigate them? How is AI explainability related to fairness?
* How do inherent fairness problems in AI models affect human beings?  


## Primary Objectives, Quarter 1
* Introduce students to the area in which they will do their project through replicating a known result.
* Create written material and code that serves as a foundation for work in quarter-2’s projects.
* Closely read example papers in the domain to learn best-practices for communication in the chosen field.

## Result replication (introduction to topic)
