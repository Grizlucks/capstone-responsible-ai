# Replication Project Part 0: Introduction

## Class Coverage
This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
* Lecture: Introduce the Q1 (replication) project objectives, the AI Fairness 360 model overview, and the medical expenditure tutorial
* Workshop: Initiate logistics for the replication project: datasets, code repo, and setup. A brief overview of EDA.
* Survey: What's your role in a data science team?

## Pre-Class Readings
Please read the following:
* [AI fairness 360: an extensible toolkit for detecting, understanding, and mitigating unwanted algorithmic bias](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01943.pdf) (Bellamy et al.)
* [Datasheets for Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) (Gebru et al.)
* [AI Fairness 360 Demo](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/data)

## Participation Questions 
_Submit to Gradescope by 10AM PT on Thursday, October 13th_
* What are some ways that data can introduce bias into an AI/ML model? List as many as you can think of.
* Walk through the AIF360 demo(s) and explore the functionality. When comparing to your list of how data can introduce bias in an AI/ML models, did the tool help understand *how* data can introduce bias? 
* After going through the AIF360 demo, what are some missing any features that you think are important? What is still unclear?

## This Week's Slides
* [Week-03-Slides](https://github.com/nanrahman/capstone-responsible-ai/blob/483282f030af9225528cee3935203bb612ca71da/notes/week-03/Week-3-slides.pdf)

## Assigned for Week 04
Complete the following tasks:
* Replication Pre-Work (Part #0): Using [QuickStart Guide](https://github.com/nanrahman/capstone-responsible-ai/blob/483282f030af9225528cee3935203bb612ca71da/notes/week-03/Quick-start.md), set up your notebook
  * Primary contact for replication project: Nandita Rahman (nanrahman@deloitte.com)
* Fill out the [data science team persona survey](https://forms.gle/5Fv7XZDABVEzphQ88) by 10 AM PT, Thursday, October 20th

**Note:** These tasks will be difficult, and will potentially take a while to compute, so start early!
